gstat now comes in two flavours: a stand-alone executable, and a package
that can be used from within R. Both share a common set of C source code,
which is held in subdirectory src. All R related files are held under
subdirectory S. The source R package files are in S/man (manual pages),
S/src (R / S code), S/test, S/demo, S/data. To produce the R package, all
needed code is copied (and partially filtered) from gstat/src directory
and all source directories under gstat/S to relevant directories under
gstat/S/R/gstat, from where the actual sources reside.

the gstat stand-alone manual and other information at the gstat home
page, http://www.gstat.org/ . R package manual pages are installed
automatically.

source distribution -- contents of the directories:
===================================================
src       : gstat sources code, copyright notice
meschach  : meschach matrix library (basic/dense/sparse routines)
include   : include file directory
lib       : where the compiled libraries go (libcsf.a, libmeschach.a)
cmd       : example command files
S         : gstat R package and S-Plus library directories

to build gstat stand-alone, type:

	./configure
	make

and to install the software, type:

	make install

to check which command make would invoke, try:

	make install -n

(note that configure takes several options; try

	./configure --help

for a list)

To build and check the gstat R package, type:
	
	cd S
	make r-build
	make r-check
